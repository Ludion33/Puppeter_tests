# Puppeter_tests

Currently learning how Puppeteer works, this repo will contain parts of my works on that node Library

It's separated in 2 files : index_github.js and index_leboncoin.js 

The first one launches chromium and log in Githhub to get the names and email addresses of everyone with a John in it's pseudo.

The second one goes to lebonchoin and checks the first flatsharing ad, and get its description.
